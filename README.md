The Definition of Successor ML
==========

These sources are derived from the SML '97 version of the Definition of
Standard ML by integrating the changes documented in the *HaMLet* 1.3.1S
documentation (http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/hamlet-succ-1.3.1S5.pdf).
See Appendix F in the document for a detailed list of the changes.

To build a PDF, perform the following steps in a terminal window:
