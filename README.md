Successor ML
============

Successor ML is an effort to *evolve* the Standard ML language while keeping true
to its clean and elegant design.

A related effort is the evolution of the
[**Standard ML Basis Library**](https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary).

== Definition

The LaTeX sources for **The Definition of Successor ML** can be found in the
`definition` directory.

== Design proposals

== Implementation efforts

At this time, there are three implementation efforts to support Successor ML.

+ The most complete is Andreas Rossberg's [**HaMLet S**](https://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/)
  implementation, which implements all of the features described in the
  **The Definition of Successor ML** (and more).

+ The [**MLton**](https://mlton.org) implementation of Standard ML is implementing
  Successor ML features.  See [http://mlton.org/SuccessorML] for details.

+ The [**Standard ML of New Jersey**](https://smlnj.org) implementation of Standard ML
  is also implementing Successor ML features
  (as of [Version 110.79](http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.79/110.79-README.html)).
